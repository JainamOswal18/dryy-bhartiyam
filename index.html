      <h3 class="j">Day - 1 Retro/Character Day</h3>
      <p class="j d d1">I was busy in webdev when I got a call from my friend Rushikesh to come for the event. I came for the event poorly dressed. In that event I enjoyed the flashmob and the rampwork as there was one of my favourite character's cosplay ( Roronoa Zoro ). The dance performance of branches : CSBS and CE was very commendable. Immediately after the event I went home.</p>

      <h3 class="j">Day - 2 Party Attire Day</h3>
      <p class="j d d2">On this day, I was comparatively well-dressed . The event was getting delayed. I enjoyed the flashmob of Art Circle Group. The event was over by 6:30. After that we went home.</p>

      </div>

      <h3 class="j">Day - 3 - Traditional Day</h3>
      <p class="j d d3">On this day I was properly-dressed in traditional wear. The event started with very good Indian Drums Play(Dhol-Tasha/Pathak). After that was the teaching faculty's rampwalk followed by JamX. In JamX there were Live Performance. We enjoyed the event and after the event I spend time with my friends and clicked photos which I attached at the top. This day was by-far the best day of the event. </p>

      </div>

      <h3 class="j">Day - 4 - Bhartiyam Day 1</h3>
      <p class="j d d4">This was the first day of our main event. In this we had opening ceremony in the morning in which I was not very intrested so I didn't showed up. I came after lunch and firstly attended the BAZM E SHAAM (hindi and urdu poetry); not because I like it but rather for my friend who was anchoring the event(the event was good though). After that was the dance competition which was the best part of the event. In evening there was a grand stage setted up on our sports ground. There was FASHION EUPHORIA event in which our teaching faculty and students participated. We all attended that event because we were getting a FREEEE dinner, which we thought would be the best part to recover our 200k college fees. I had a great time with my friends. </p>
    
      <h3 class="j">Day - 5 - Bhartiyam Day 2</h3>
      <p class="j d d4">Last and final day of Bhartiyam. I was waiting for my friend's call but i didn't received it. In morning AUTO expo and stunt show was there ; which was a good event (this is what I was informed by my friends). In afternoon fews events were there which again I missed because I didn't had anyone to give me a company. I came in evening well-dressed and enjoyed the final event in which we had dance-singing-acting ; all three best events. Alas with everyone demanding for dj night and principal and management personels kicking everyone out, the final event and "The Bhartiyam " ended. </p>

      <h2 class="j">Summary</h2>
      <p class="j para">The event was a great way of relaxation as we've exams coming after a week and was a crucial part of everyone's college life. I personally enjoyed in the college fest. Next year I believe I would be busy in participating or rather contributing to everyone else's enjoyment. </p>
